## What is a Candlestick?

A candlestick is a way of displaying information about an asset\'s price
movement. Candlestick charts are one of the most popular components of
technical analysis, enabling traders to interpret price information
quickly and from just a few price bars.

Each candlestick has three basic features:

-   The body, which represents the open-to-close range
-   The shadow, that indicates the intra-day high and low
-   The colour, which reveals the direction of market movement -- a
    green (or white) body indicates a price increase, while a red (or
    black) body shows a price decrease
